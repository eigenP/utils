## 2024-05-22 - Partition of Unity at Boundaries
**Learning:** Patch-based image reconstruction (like extended depth of focus) often relies on a "Partition of Unity" assumption where blending weights sum to 1. Using a single tapered weight window for all patches violates this at image boundaries, causing signal loss (dimming or zeroing) at the edges.
**Action:** Property-based tests for affine equivariance ($f(\alpha I + \beta) = \alpha f(I) + \beta$) are highly effective at detecting these boundary normalization errors, as they fail if regions are implicitly scaled by $<1.0$. Future patch-blending implementations must explicitly handle boundary weight conditions.
