## 2025-02-12 - Continuous Surface Sampling in Extended Depth of Focus
**Learning:** Piecewise constant approximations (like patch blending with a single Z-value per patch) introduce significant artifacts (banding, staircase) when reconstructing slanted or curved surfaces. Decoupling the estimation grid (sparse patches) from the reconstruction grid (full resolution) allows for smooth surface extraction without increasing the cost of focus estimation.
**Action:** Prefer continuous function reconstruction (e.g., interpolation of parameters followed by per-pixel evaluation) over discrete block assembly when the underlying model (surface depth) varies smoothly.
