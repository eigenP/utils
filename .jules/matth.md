## 2024-05-22 - Robust Cluster Annotation
**Learning:** Parametric statistical tests (like the Z-test for mean difference) are fragile when applied to biological score distributions, which are often skewed, zero-inflated, or contain outliers. A cluster can be 95% "Type A" by headcount, but a few strong outliers can drag the mean difference to zero or negative, causing parametric confidence to collapse to ~0.5.
**Action:** Prefer non-parametric, rank-based, or counting statistics for confidence estimation in heterogeneous biological data. specifically, the "Empirical Probability of Superiority" (Mann-Whitney U statistic) $P(S_1 > S_2)$ provides a robust and interpretable measure of "how much of the cluster is better explained by the top label".
