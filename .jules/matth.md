## 2024-05-22 - Generalized Moran's I Formula for Irregular Graphs
**Learning:** The standard simplified formula for Moran's I ($I = \frac{N}{S_0} \frac{x^T W x}{x^T x}$) assumes either row-standardized weights ($S_0=N$) OR ignores the impact of the mean ($\bar{x}$) on the cross-product term for irregular graphs. Specifically, the expansion of the numerator $\sum_{ij} w_{ij} (x_i - \bar{x})(x_j - \bar{x})$ includes terms $-\bar{x} \sum_i x_i R_i$ and $-\bar{x} \sum_j x_j C_j$ (where $R_i, C_j$ are row/col sums of $W$). If the graph has isolated nodes ($R_i=0$) or general weights ($R_i \neq 1$), these terms do not cancel out with $+S_0 \bar{x}^2$ as they do in the regular/standardized case. Neglecting them leads to bias when the mean is non-zero, making the statistic sensitive to simple shifts in data.

**Action:** When implementing spatial statistics, always use the general quadratic form expansion rather than simplified versions that rely on implicit assumptions about graph regularity or weight normalization. I updated `morans_i_all_fast` to include the full expansion: $\text{Num} = x^T W x - \bar{x}(x^T W \mathbf{1}) - \bar{x}(\mathbf{1}^T W x) + \bar{x}^2 S_0$. This ensures correctness for any weight matrix (binary, inverse-distance, etc.) and any topology (including disconnected components).

## 2024-05-23 - Cubic Interpolation for Z-Reconstruction
**Learning:** In Extended Depth of Focus (EDOF), using linear interpolation to reconstruct pixel intensities from fractional Z-depths acts as a low-pass filter, significantly attenuating contrast and peak intensity (by >10% for sharp foci). This degradation counteracts the benefits of sub-pixel depth estimation. While linear interpolation is sufficient for smooth geometric transformations, it fails to preserve the spectral characteristics of the in-focus image, which is by definition a local maximum in sharpness/intensity.

**Action:** Use Cubic (Catmull-Rom) interpolation for intensity reconstruction when sampling from a discrete stack at fractional coordinates. This preserves the high-frequency content and peak intensity of the focused features, aligning the reconstruction quality with the precision of the depth map.
