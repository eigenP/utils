## 2025-02-18 - Bias in Moran's I Formula for Irregular Weights
**Learning:** The simplified matrix formula for Moran's I numerator ($x^T W x - \bar{x} x^T C$) relies on the assumption that $W$ is row-standardized (or regular), such that $\bar{x} \sum_i x_i R_i = \bar{x}^2 S_0$. For irregular, non-standardized weights (e.g., raw adjacency or inverse distance), this assumption fails ($R_i$ is not constant), introducing a bias term $-\bar{x} (x^T R - \bar{x} S_0)$.
**Action:** Always use the generalized quadratic form or explicitly account for the row-sum term $-\bar{x} (x^T R)$ when implementing spatial statistics to ensure robustness against arbitrary weight definitions.
