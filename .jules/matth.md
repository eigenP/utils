## 2024-05-22 - Generalized Moran's I Formula for Irregular Graphs
**Learning:** The standard simplified formula for Moran's I ($I = \frac{N}{S_0} \frac{x^T W x}{x^T x}$) assumes either row-standardized weights ($S_0=N$) OR ignores the impact of the mean ($\bar{x}$) on the cross-product term for irregular graphs. Specifically, the expansion of the numerator $\sum_{ij} w_{ij} (x_i - \bar{x})(x_j - \bar{x})$ includes terms $-\bar{x} \sum_i x_i R_i$ and $-\bar{x} \sum_j x_j C_j$ (where $R_i, C_j$ are row/col sums of $W$). If the graph has isolated nodes ($R_i=0$) or general weights ($R_i \neq 1$), these terms do not cancel out with $+S_0 \bar{x}^2$ as they do in the regular/standardized case. Neglecting them leads to bias when the mean is non-zero, making the statistic sensitive to simple shifts in data.

**Action:** When implementing spatial statistics, always use the general quadratic form expansion rather than simplified versions that rely on implicit assumptions about graph regularity or weight normalization. I updated `morans_i_all_fast` to include the full expansion: $\text{Num} = x^T W x - \bar{x}(x^T W \mathbf{1}) - \bar{x}(\mathbf{1}^T W x) + \bar{x}^2 S_0$. This ensures correctness for any weight matrix (binary, inverse-distance, etc.) and any topology (including disconnected components).

## 2024-05-23 - Cubic Interpolation for Z-Reconstruction
**Learning:** In Extended Depth of Focus (EDOF), using linear interpolation to reconstruct pixel intensities from fractional Z-depths acts as a low-pass filter, significantly attenuating contrast and peak intensity (by >10% for sharp foci). This degradation counteracts the benefits of sub-pixel depth estimation. While linear interpolation is sufficient for smooth geometric transformations, it fails to preserve the spectral characteristics of the in-focus image, which is by definition a local maximum in sharpness/intensity.

**Action:** Use Cubic (Catmull-Rom) interpolation for intensity reconstruction when sampling from a discrete stack at fractional coordinates. This preserves the high-frequency content and peak intensity of the focused features, aligning the reconstruction quality with the precision of the depth map.

## 2024-05-24 - Stationary Window Bias in Phase Correlation
**Learning:** Applying a stationary window (e.g., Tukey) to moving objects before cross-correlation introduces a systematic bias towards zero shift. The window attenuates the signal overlap asymmetrically, pulling the correlation peak towards the window center. This bias is small per step but accumulates linearly in pairwise registration (random walk drift), leading to significant errors over long sequences (e.g., >0.8 px over 5 cycles).
Wait, "random walk" usually implies variance growing as sqrt(T), but here the bias is *linear* with T.
**Action:** Implement iterative windowing or "shift-compensated windowing". Estimate the shift, align the moving signal to the reference (using high-order interpolation to preserve spectral content), and re-estimate the residual shift. This ensures the window is applied symmetrically to the aligned signals, eliminating the bias. Using cubic interpolation for the alignment step is crucial to prevent interpolation smoothing from biasing the correlation peak.
